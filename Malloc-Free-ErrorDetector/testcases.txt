Test 1:
input: Trying to free pointer that was never allocated. free(&x) 
output: Error: pointer was never allocated to memory.

Expected Output is Actual output.

Test 2:
input: Trying to free a pointer more than once. free(s) free(s)
output: Error: pointer was never allocated to memory.

Expected Output is Actual output.

Test 3:
input: Malloc and then free a pointer. 

int* x = (int*)malloc(sizeof(int))
free(x)

output: x is freed succesfully.

Expected Output is actual output.

Test 4:
input: malloc a long, a long, an int and a char, then free all three.
output: all pointers were freed successfully.

Expected output is actual output.

Test 5: Heap Overflow Test
input: int *x = (int*)malloc(sizeof(int) * 1250));
output: Not enough space to malloc size of 5000

Expected output is actual output.
