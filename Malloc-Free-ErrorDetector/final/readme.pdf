In our design we decided to go with a doubly linked list, for the efficiency of fragementation. 

We first created a linked list of 5000 nodes each worth one byte. When someone mallocs we join the nodes into one node the size of the malloc. 

So after malloc of sizeof(int) = 4, there will be 4996 nodes with the last one being 4 bytes. 

We then move all the user  malloced nodes to the front of the list and leave all the free ones at the end . 

We also employed various techniques such as keeping a variable isFree in the node and data, which helps us keep track of nodes that have been freed and mallocd. 

With this implemntation it was easy to keep track of the free space and which nodes have been allocated. 

We also created a mapping array, to map the data to the specific node on the linked list.
