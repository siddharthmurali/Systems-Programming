The test plan. 

In order to thoroughly test the Sorted-List library, we followed the below plan. 

1. We first created the sorted list of ints, with 5 random numbers. Then we permutated the numbers and made sure that each time the insertion worked and was in order. 
2. The next step was to test removing a node. Again, using the interface in main.c we permutated all the possible nodes you can remove (front, middle, and last nodes). 
3. The next step was to test the iterators. We began by first creating two iterators and making sure the SLGet and SlNext  items worked. Once that was assurred, we made 
   sure that when removing a node with a iterator pointing to it, it didnt delete it. After testing this we then tested that it did get deleted. Once this was thoroughly 
   tested, we made sure that when the iterator got to the end of the list it would return null. 
4. After these were tested, we made sure that the deletiong of iterators and nodes worked 

This test plan allowed us to thoroughly test the code and make sure that every possible case was accounted for.
